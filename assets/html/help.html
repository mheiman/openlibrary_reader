<p>Welcome to the <strong>OL Reader</strong> app for Open Library. I created it because I love to read, but I wanted a
simpler, tablet-oriented interface to the riches available at Open Library. I hope you enjoy it.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p><strong>OL Reader</strong> requires that you have an Open Library (or Internet Archive) account, and that you be
connected to the Internet while you use it. All of your data is stored on the Open Library site,
and reading takes place through Open Library's Bookreader web app. This app can't do much if it loses
    contact with the Open Library servers.</p>
<p>It would be nice to be able to read books while offline, but the Open Library's checkout system makes
that complex. If you need offline access, Open Library offers options for downloading books; see their FAQ.</p>

<h2>Logging In</h2>
<p>You need to be logged in to Open Library in order to manage your bookshelves and read books. If you don't have
    an account, you can create one at <a href='http://openlibrary.org'>http://openlibrary.org</a></p>

<p>Once you've logged in to the app, your credentials are securely stored on your device, so you won't need to repeat this
step unless you log out or change your password.</p>

<h2>Managing Your Books</h2>
<p>Open Library has a feature called <strong>My Reading Log</strong> where you can place books in three categories: Want to Read, Currently Reading,
    and Already Read. <strong>OL Reader</strong> represents these categories as visual bookshelves, called To Read, Reading, and Have Read (to save space).</p>

<p>Any changes you make to these categories at Open Library will be reflected in <strong>OL Reader</strong>, and vice versa. Basic operations like adding, moving
and removing books are easy in <strong>OL Reader</strong>, but you may need to go to Open Library for other tasks.</p>

<p>Your books are represented as pictures of the covers (or sometimes title pages). To read a book, just tap the cover.</p>

<p>Each book also has a menu button at the top right. This allows to you take a variety of actions related to the book:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Manage shelf:</strong> The first set of options on the menu allow you to move the book to a different shelf, or remove it
        from your shelves completely.</li>
    <li><strong>Return Book:</strong> (only shown if you've checked the book out) Return the book before your loan period is over
    so that someone else can read it.</li>
    <li><strong>Book Info:</strong> See more information about the book; author, publication date, sometimes a description, plus a link to
    view the book record at Open Library.</li>
    <li><strong>Change Edition:</strong> Choose a different copy of the book to save on your shelf (see <strong>Works and Editions</strong> below)</li>
    <li><strong>Related Titles:</strong> Search Open Library for similar books, based on author, title, subjects, etc. Inconsistent but often
    interesting.</li>
</ul>

<p>On some books, you may notice a symbol on the bottom right. This is telling you something about the loan status of the book.</p>
<ul>
    <li>A clock icon with a number in it indicates that you have a one-hour loan on this book, and the number tells you how many minutes remain.</li>
    <li>A calendar icon with a number in it indicates you have a 14-day loan, and the number tells you how many full days you have left. You'll
    never see a 14 (because you only have 14 full days during moment you start the loan) and 0 indicates you're on your last day.</li>
    <li>A red calendar icon with an X indicates that this particular edition (see <strong>Works and Editions</strong> below) is not currently
    available for checkout. You can try using the menu button to look for another edition that may be available. Sometimes the Open Library
    data about availability is wrong, so there's no harm in opening the book to see for sure.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>If you add or remove books from shelves while using the Open Library web site, the app may not pick up the changes instantly. To force
all the data to resynchronize, just tap the Reload icon at the top right of the screen.</p>

<h3>Works and Editions</h3>
<p>You'll get more out of Open Library if you understand a little about Works and Editions. Many books have been published multiple times,
sometimes by different publishers, with different covers, page counts, etc. Each of these different books is called an <em>Edition.</em>
However, they're all essentially the same, all versions of the same <em>Work.</em> When you search for a book at Open Library, you get a
list of Works, and within those Works there are often multiple Editions. Some of those Editions are books that you can read, others
represent versions that Open Library doesn't have a copy of.</p>
<p>When it's time to read a book, however, you can't read a Work. You have to read a particular Edition, a physical set of pages that
    Open Library holds in its collection.</p>
<p>When you put a book on a Reading Log shelf, the particular Edition that you get is sometimes arbitrary. That's why the book menu has
a <strong>Change Edition</strong> option. This lets you choose a particular ebook edition to have on your shelf for reading.</p>
<p>Note: Your reading history (what page you're on in a book) is attached to the edition you last read, so if you change editions
while you're in the middle of a book, you'll have to manually scroll through the new edition to find your place.</p>

<h3>What About Lists?</h3>
OL Reader doesn't support working with Open Library Lists at this time. If you have suggestions for how incorporating Lists
into the app would make your life better, please send a note to olreader@loomis-house.com.

<h2>Reading a Book</h2>
<p><strong>OL Reader</strong> uses the Internet Archive's web-based bookreader to show you scanned pages of your selected book; if you're
accustomed to reading books from Open Library or Internet Archive in your browser, the experience will be familiar, but with some extra enhancements.
Because your reading is happening online at the Internet Archive, you must be connected to a network while you read.</p>

<h3>Full Screen Mode</h3>
<p><strong>OL Reader</strong> provides a true full screen mode to remove all distractions while you're reading. You can activate this mode by tapping the dark background
around the book on your screen, or tapping the very top of the screen. In this mode, everything except for the book is hidden, and the pages are about 30% larger.  To show the navigation and settings tools
again, just tap the background or screen top again. If your book loan expires while you are reading in full screen mode, full screen mode will exit so you can deal
with renewing your loan.</p>

<h3>Turning Pages</h3>
<p>In two-up mode (two pages shown at once), the online bookreader allows you to turn pages by tapping the right page to move forward a page and the left page to move back. <strong>OL Reader</strong>
adds additional gestures to make page turns easier (especially one-handed). A swipe from right to left on any portion of the screen will turn the page forward;
a swipe from left to right will turn back. These gestures also advance the pages in one-up mode.</p>

<h3>Handling Loans</h3>
<p>When you tap the cover of a book on your shelf and it is available to borrow, it's automatically checked out to you as a 1 hour loan.  If a 14 day loan is available, you'll
see a button to do a longer checkout in the banner above the book pages. You may also see an option to join a waitlist if the book isn't currently available.</p>
<p>If your loan expires while you are reading, or while you've been away from the app, you'll see other options in the banner; for instance, to borrow for another hour.</p>
<p>While a loan is active, you'll see a Return Now button. This allows you to end your loan and make the book available to others. If you navigate back to your bookshelves or close the
    app without returning a book, it will stay checked out to you until the loan period ends.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>Sometimes things go wrong with the online bookreader. The best thing to do in most cases is to tap the reload button at the top right of the reading screen. This will reload the book
at your current page and reset most problems.</p>


<h2>Settings</h2>
<p><strong>OL Reader</strong> currently has four exciting settings, available from the same sidebar where you found this help.</p>
<h3>Move books to "Reading" shelf when opened</h3>
<p>If you turn this one on, every time you open a book that's not on your "Reading" shelf, it will automatically get moved there.
    Nice if you're just working your way through the items in "To Read", annoying if you pop in and out of books wherever.</p>

<h3>Show time/battery in full screen reading mode</h3>
<p>When you activate the full screen reading mode by tapping the reader background or at the top of the screen,
    everything except your book is hidden. If it makes you anxious not to be able to see the time and battery level, switch this on.</p>

<h3>Skeuomorph me!</h3>
<p>Toggles natural textures for those that want more flavor of the physical world of books.</p>

<h3>Book cover size</h3>
<p>Adjust the size of the covers and text on your shelves to meet your needs.</p>
